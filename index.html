  <h2>My Projects</h2>

  <section class="project memory-allocator">
    <h2>Memory Allocator</h2>
    <p>A dynamic storage allocator project focused on space utilization and throughput.
    It includes functions that allocate and free a requested block size while maintaining 16-byte alignment.
    An explicit free list is used to quickly find suitable memory blocks as well as unmapping unused page chunks for better efficiency.
    A heap consistency checker function is included used to ensure no storage corruption or errors occur. 
    The full implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/hud13/projects" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>

  <section class="project four-bit-computer">
    <h2>4-Bit Computer</h2>
    <p>A simple computer implementation project based around the principle of Von Neumann Architecture.
    Given a desired datapath definition, this project transformed a conceptual finite state machine into a functional control unit integrated onto a Field-Programmable-Gate-Array (FPGA) board. 
    Logic gates and sequential circuits were implemented using Verilog, and verified through a testbench program and waveform analysis. 
    The design was downloaded and verified on an FPGA board, correctly responding to the board's physical switches and internal clock. 
    Full control unit Verilog and testbench code can be found <a href="https://github.com/hud13/projects" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>

  <section class="project snake-game">
    <h2>Snake Game</h2>
    <p>A recreation of the classic snake game I collaborated on with a team. 
    This web-based game can be played over a local network with bots or human players, 
    and featured a constantly updating game data page handled by frequent SQL queries and responses. 
    CSS was used to visualy represent JSON-formatted data through a client connection to the server. 
    Partial game and network code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/hud13/projects" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>

  <section class="project amplifier-design">
    <h2>Amplifier Design</h2>
    <p>A collection of projects revolving around constructing amplifier circuits to be used in a microphone.
    PSPICE was used to construct a circuit schematic with appropriate component values for both BJT and MOSFET style amplifiers for a 15V power supply. 
    Circuit behavior was simulated to ensure correct response throughout an appropriate range of frequencies. 
    The circuit was then constructed and verified through a testing process involving oscilloscope measurements of expected frequency and current. 

    (more details here button that shows more pictures of the process here)
    (Separate bjt and mosfet amplifier designs are shown in a drop down style page)
