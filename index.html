  <h2>My Projects</h2>

  <section class="project memory-allocator">
    <h2>Memory Allocator</h2>
    <p>A dynamic storage allocator project focused on space utilization and throughput.
    It includes functions that allocate and free a requested block size while maintaining 16-byte alignment.
    An explicit free list is used to quickly find suitable memory blocks as well as unmapping unused page chunks for better efficiency.
    A heap consistency checker function is included to ensure no storage corruption or errors occur. 
    The full implementation can be found here: <a href="#">GITHUB LINK</a></p>

  <section class="project four-bit-computer">
    <h2>4-Bit Computer</h2>
    <p>A simple computer implementation project based on Von Neumann Architecture.
    A finite state machine was transformed into a control unit for an FPGA board using Verilog.
    Verified through testbenches and waveform analysis.

  <section class="project snake-game">
    <h2>Snake Game</h2>
    <p>A team-built web-based version of the snake game playable over a local network.
    Game state was managed with SQL and rendered using CSS from JSON server responses.

  <section class="project amplifier-design">
    <h2>Amplifier Design</h2>
    <p>Amplifier circuits (BJT and MOSFET) were designed and simulated in PSPICE, then constructed and tested with oscilloscope analysis for use in a microphone system.
